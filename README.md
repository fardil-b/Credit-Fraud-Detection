# Credit-Fraud-Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection as a Classification Problem
In this project, we will predict the credit card fraud in the transactional dataset using some of the predictive models.

## Task
- Perform EDA using Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis
- Preprocessing using LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
- Apply Linear Algorithms like Logistic Regression model
- Apply Non Linear Algorithms like SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K Nearest Neighbour) and Naive Bayes
- Apply Non Linear Algorithms like CART (Classification and Regression Trees)
- Apply Ensemble Algorithms like RandomForest, Bagging CART, Gradient Boosting model
- Perform GLMNet Regression analysis
- Apply Neural Network model
- Compare results of different models and select the best model

The Credit Card Fraud detection Dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset present transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

The dataset has been collected and analyzed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection. More details on current and past projects on related topics are available on https://mlg.ulb.ac.be/wordpress/projects/
